<strong>Tracking Pixel Recon Email:</strong><br>
 <p align="center">
Email that can be spam or social engineering that is combined with a tracking pixel, this allows the attacker to see if the email was viewed.This allows the attacker to see how active that email address is by looking at the time spam between sending the email and opening the email. A code using HTML code in the email body links to a pixel server. Once email is opened a message back to the server.<br>
Information that can gathered via Pixel:<br>
- Ip address<br>
- Date/Time email opened<br>
- Client Used (Webmail or Email)<br>
- Mobile or Desktop<br>

<h2>Credential Harvester Emails</h2>
<p align="center">
Credential Harvesters are considered the most common phishing email, it uses human weakness and fear to retrieve valid credentials users use on everyday services and accounts. The emails are set up to look like a legit email from a company such as impersonating Amazon,AT&T, and Outlook. This email will have a attached link, that impersonating a real login portal. The user enters the credentials and it is then stored in a directory or email back to the attacker.<br>
